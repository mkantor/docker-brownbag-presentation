# Slides for a presentation about Docker, in Docker!

Slides are presented using [remark](http://remarkjs.com/) via
[markdown-to-slides](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-slides).

`./run` is a handy helper script to build and launch the slideshow. It requires
the docker and docker-compose CLI tools.

## To use presenter mode:

1. Run the presentation.
1. Press "c" to open a new window for the actual presentation.
1. Focus the original window again, then press "p" to enter presenter mode.

The two windows will remain in sync, so you can show one to the audience and
the other to yourself.
